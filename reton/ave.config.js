    <p>
        I was born in 1991 and grew up in Puebla, Mexico.
        After I finished studying as an automotive design engineer, I started working on projects for Volkswagen.
        Then, I joined Lightyear's mission, where I helped develop the world's first long-range solar electric vehicle that's production-ready.
      </p><p>
          Outside of work you can find me in the GYM or at CorssFit competitions.
        </p><p>
          That's me doing (and almost dying in the process) a 140 kilos clean.
